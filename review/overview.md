# Rainforest Foods Website - Complete Beginner's Guide

## What is this project?

Imagine you want to create a website like Amazon, but for healthy organic foods. That's exactly what we've built! This is a complete e-commerce (online shopping) website where people can:

- Browse different superfood products
- Search for specific items
- Add products to a shopping cart
- View detailed product information
- Learn about the company

## What does "Full-Stack" mean?

Think of a restaurant:
- **Frontend** = The dining room where customers sit and order (what users see and interact with)
- **Backend** = The kitchen where food is prepared (the server that handles data and logic)
- **Full-Stack** = Building both the dining room AND the kitchen

## Technology Stack (The Tools We Use)

### Frontend (What Users See)
- **React** - A tool for building interactive websites (like LEGO blocks for web pages)
- **TypeScript** - JavaScript with safety features (catches mistakes before they happen)
- **CSS** - Makes the website look beautiful with colors, fonts, and layouts

### Backend (The Server)
- **Node.js** - Lets us use JavaScript to build servers (normally JavaScript only works in browsers)
- **Express** - A framework that makes building servers easier (like a toolbox for server development)
- **TypeScript** - Same safety features as frontend
- **JSON Files** - Simple text files that store our product data (like a mini-database)

## What Can Users Do on This Website?

### 1. Browse Products
- See all available superfoods
- Filter by category (powders, seeds, berries)
- Sort by name or price

### 2. Search for Products
- Type in a search box to find specific items
- Get instant results

### 3. View Product Details
- Click on any product to see full information
- See price, description, and benefits
- Check if it's in stock

### 4. Shopping Cart
- Add products to cart
- Change quantities
- Remove items
- See total price
- Cart remembers items even if you close the browser

### 5. Learn About the Company
- Read about the company's mission
- Contact information

## How Does It All Work Together?

1. **User opens website** â†’ Frontend loads in browser
2. **User clicks "Products"** â†’ Frontend asks backend for product data
3. **Backend receives request** â†’ Looks up products in JSON files
4. **Backend sends data back** â†’ Frontend displays products beautifully
5. **User adds to cart** â†’ Frontend stores cart in browser memory
6. **Everything happens instantly** â†’ Modern web magic!

## What You'll Learn From This Project

### Programming Concepts
- **Variables** - Storing information (like name = "John")
- **Functions** - Reusable pieces of code (like recipes you can use again)
- **Objects** - Grouping related information (like a product with name, price, description)
- **Arrays** - Lists of things (like a list of products)
- **APIs** - How different programs talk to each other

### Web Development Concepts
- **Client-Server Architecture** - How websites are structured
- **HTTP Requests** - How browsers ask servers for information
- **JSON** - A way to send data between programs
- **Routing** - How different URLs show different pages
- **State Management** - How to remember information as users interact

### Real-World Skills
- **Project Organization** - How to structure code professionally
- **Error Handling** - What to do when things go wrong
- **Responsive Design** - Making websites work on phones and computers
- **Version Control** - Tracking changes to your code (with Git)

## Why These Technologies?

### TypeScript over JavaScript
- **Catches mistakes early** - Like spell-check for code
- **Better tools** - Your editor can help you more
- **Easier to understand** - Code is more self-documenting

### React for Frontend
- **Popular and supported** - Lots of help available online
- **Component-based** - Build big things from small, reusable pieces
- **Fast and efficient** - Only updates parts of the page that change

### Node.js for Backend
- **Same language** - Use JavaScript/TypeScript for everything
- **Fast development** - Quick to build and test
- **Large community** - Tons of tools and libraries available
